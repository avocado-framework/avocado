This is a set of ansible playbooks and supporting code to test the
deployment of Avocado in a number of different environments, and
installed via a number of different methods. The following Ansible
playbooks are available here:

 - pip-git.yml: deployment of Avocado and Avocado-VT using pip, from a
   GIT repository, on a Python virtual environment.  Tested on EL7,
   Fedora 28 and Fedora 29.

 - rpm-copr.yml: deployment of Avocado and Avocado-VT using RPM, from
   a Copr repository that follows the latest Avocado and Avocado-VT
   from the GitHub repository master branch. Tested on EL7, Fedora 28
   and Fedora 29.

 - rpm-copr-avocado-only.yml: deployment of Avocado using RPM, from
   a Copr repository that follows the latest Avocado.  Tested on EL8.

 - rpm-repo.yml: deployment of Avocado and Avocado-VT using RPM, from
   the official release repository. Fedora 29 and Fedora 30.

Usage:
======

These are intended to be used as regular playbooks, so roughly the
following steps should be followed:

 1) Install ansible.  If you need help, refer to
    https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide

 2) Adjust your inventory, that is, the hosts that will be used on the
    playbook execution.  The simplest way is to edit the inventory
    file this directory.

 3) (OPTIONAL) adjust your configuration on vars.yml

 4) Run a playbook with: ansible-playbook <PLAYBOOK_FILE_NAME>

All-in-one execution in container:
----------------------------------

It may be useful to run a playbook in a fresh container.  One example
of a onliner that can achieve that:

  podman run --rm -ti fedora:30 /bin/bash -c 'dnf -y install git ansible && ansible-pull -v -U git://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado -i selftests/deployment/inventory -c local selftests/deployment/rpm-copr.yml'
