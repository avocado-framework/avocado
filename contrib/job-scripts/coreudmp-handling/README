These are a set of scripts that will:

* Setup the core pattern to the "coredumps" sub directory of the
  current job
* Restore the original settings once the job finishes running tests
* Links the core files (if any) on the job level "coredumps" subdir
  into the test result specific "coredumps" dir based on the PID and
  log file pattern matching.  Other conditions could be added.

One setting that has to be done by yourself, either in your session or
as a systemwide configuration is setting the core file size limits, or
more exactly.  Just run:

 $ ulimit -c unlimited

Or set it permanently with an entry in /etc/security/limits.conf, or
add a file to /etc/security/limits.d.

To enable those during a development session, set the following configuration
content:

[plugins.jobscripts]
pre = <THIS_FOLDER_PATH>/pre.d/
post = <THIS_FOLDER_PATH>/post.d/
warn_non_existing_dir = True
warn_non_zero_status = True

WARNING: Since the core pattern is a system wide setting, if you run
multiple parallel jobs with these scripts, the result is pretty much
unpredictable and prone to errors.
