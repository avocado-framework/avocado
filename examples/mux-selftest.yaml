# joinlist: list which gets combined while getting environment
# corruptlist: list which is overwritten with string and again by list
# /distro: should be merged from two separated trees into the position of
#          the first one. PS: Don't do this in production, it works but
#          it's not nice and readable... here it simulates the use of
#          multiple files and checks that the node ordering works fine.
# /env/opt_CFLAGS: Should be present in merged node
# /env/prod/opt_CFLAGS: value should be overridden by latter node
# The internal filters are designed to be used for this file injected into
# /virt (use -m /virt:examples/mux-selftest.py). When it's injected into
# a different location those filters should not affect the result (produces
# all variants.
# !filter-only: All root childern are specified in different levels. They
#               should be combined and together enable all variants. On the
#               other hand they should not enable other-level filter-only
#               filters like /hw/disk/virtio.
