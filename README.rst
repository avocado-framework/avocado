 Avocado Test Framework
========================

Avocado is a set of tools and libraries to help with automated testing.

One can call it a test framework with benefits.  Native tests are
written in Python and they follow the unittest
(https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/unittest.html) pattern, but any
executable can serve as a test.

Avocado is composed of:

* A test runner that lets you execute tests. Those tests can be either
  written in your language of choice, or be written in Python and use
  the available libraries. In both cases, you get facilities such as
  automated log and system information collection.

* Libraries that help you write tests in a concise, yet expressive and
  powerful way.  You can find more information about what libraries
  are intended for test writers at:
  http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/utils/avocado.utils.html

* Plugins that can extend and add new functionality to the Avocado
  Framework.  More info at:
  http://avocado-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Plugins.html

Avocado is built on the experience accumulated with Autotest
(http://autotest.github.io), while improving on its weaknesses and
shortcomings.

Installing Avocado
==================

Avocado is primarily written in Python, so a standard Python installation
is possible and often preferable.

.. tip:: If you are looking for Virtualization specific testing, also
         consider looking at `Avocado-VT installation instructions
         <https://avocado-vt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GetStartedGuide.html#installing-avocado-vt>`_
         after finishing the Avocado installation.

Installing with standard Python tools
-------------------------------------

The simplest installation method is through ``pip``.  On most POSIX
systems with Python 3.4 (or later) and ``pip`` available, installation
can be performed with a single command::

  pip install --user avocado-framework

This will fetch the Avocado package (and possibly some of its
dependecies) from the PyPI repository, and will attempt to install it
in the user's home directory (usually under ``~/.local``).

Tip: If you want to perform a system-wide installation, drop the
``--user`` switch.

If you want even more isolation, Avocado can also be installed in a
Python virtual environment. with no additional steps besides creating
and activating the "venv" itself::

  python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual_environment
  . /path/to/new/virtual_environment/bin/activate
  pip install avocado-framework

Please note that this installs the Avocado core functionality.  Many
Avocado features are distributed as non-core plugins, also available
as additional packages on PyPI.  You should be able to find them via
``pip search avocado-framework-plugin | grep
avocado-framework-plugin``. Some of them are listed below:

* ``avocado-framework-plugin-glib``: Execution of GLib Test Framework tests
* ``avocado-framework-plugin-golang``: Execution of Golang tests
* ``avocado-framework-plugin-loader-yaml``: Loads tests from YAML files
* ``avocado-framework-plugin-result-html``: HTML Report for Jobs
* ``avocado-framework-plugin-result-upload``: Propagate Job results to remote host
* ``avocado-framework-plugin-resultsdb``: Propagate Job results to Resultsdb
* ``avocado-framework-plugin-robot``: Execution of Robot Framework tests
* ``avocado-framework-plugin-runner-docker``: Runner for Execution on Docker Containers
* ``avocado-framework-plugin-runner-remote``: Runner for Remote Execution

Fedora from Avocado's own Repo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Avocado project also makes the latest release, and the LTS (Long
Term Stability) releases available from its own package repository.
To use it, first get the package repositories configuration file by
running the following command::

    sudo curl https://avocado-project.org/data/repos/avocado-fedora.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/avocado.repo

Now check if you have the ``avocado`` and ``avocado-lts`` repositories configured by running::

    sudo dnf repolist avocado avocado-lts
    ...
    repo id      repo name                          status
    avocado      Avocado                            50
    avocado-lts  Avocado LTS (Long Term Stability)  disabled

Regular users of Avocado will want to use the standard ``avocado``
repository, which tracks the latest Avocado releases.  For more
information about the LTS releases, please refer to the Avocado Long
Term Stability thread
(https://www.redhat.com/archives/avocado-devel/2016-April/msg00038.html)
and to your package management docs on how to switch to the
``avocado-lts`` repo.

Finally, after deciding between regular Avocado releases or LTS, you
can install the RPM packages by running the following commands::

    dnf install python-avocado

Additionally, other Avocado packages are available for Fedora:

The OpenSUSE project packages LTS versions of Avocado
(https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Virtualization:Tests/avocado).
You can install packages by running the following commands::

  zypper install avocado

Debian
~~~~~~

DEB package support is available in the source tree (look at the
``contrib/packages/debian`` directory.  No actual packages are
provided by the Avocado project or the Debian repos.


Setting up a Development Environment
====================================

If you want to develop Avocado, or just run it directly from the GIT
repository, fetch the source code and run::

  make develop

From this point on, running ``avocado`` should load everything from
your current source code checkout.

Brief Usage Instructions
========================

To list available tests, call the ``list`` subcommand.  For example::

  avocado list

  INSTRUMENTED <examples_path>/tests/abort.py:AbortTest.test
  INSTRUMENTED <examples_path>/tests/canceltest.py:CancelTest.test
  ...
  SIMPLE       <examples_path>/tests/passtest.sh

To run a test, call the ``run`` command::

  avocado run <examples_path>/tests/passtest.sh
  JOB ID     : <id>
  JOB LOG    : <job-results>/job-<date>-<shortid>/job.log
  (1/1) <examples_path>/tests/passtest.sh: PASS (0.04 s)
  RESULTS    : PASS 1 | ERROR 0 | FAIL 0 | SKIP 0 | WARN 0 | INTERRUPT 0 | CANCEL 0
  JOB TIME   : 0.14 s

To continue exploring Avocado, check out the output of ``avocado --help``.  When
running Avocado out of package-based installs, its man page should also be
accessible via ``man avocado``.
