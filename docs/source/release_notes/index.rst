Long Term Stability Releases
============================

The LTS releases are regular releases considering the release cycle, but
a new branch is created and bugfixes are backported on demand for a
period of about 18 months after the release. Every year (or so) a new
LTS version is released. Two subsequent LTS versions are guaranteed to
have 6 months of supportability overlap.
