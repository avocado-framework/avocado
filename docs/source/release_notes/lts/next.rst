The Next LTS
============

The Long Term Stability releases of Avocado are the result of the
accumulated changes on regular (non-LTS) releases.

This section tracks the changes introduced on each regular (non-LTS)
Avocado release, and gives a sneak preview of what will make into the
next LTS release.

What's new?
===========

When compared to the last LTS (52.x), the main changes to be
introduced by the next LTS version are:

* A new loader implementation, that reuses (and resembles) the YAML
  input used for the varianter yaml_to_mux plugin.  It allows the
  definition of test suite based on a YAML file, including different
  variants for different tests.  For more information refer to
  :ref:`yaml_loader`.

* A better handling of interruption related signals, such as
  ``SIGINT`` and ``SIGTERM``.  Avocado will now try harder to not
  leave test processes that don't respond to those signals, and will
  itself behave better when it receives them.  For a complete
  description refer to :ref:`signal_handlers`.

* The output generated by tests on ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` are now
  properly prefixed with ``[stdout]`` and ``[stderr]`` in the
  ``job.log``.  The prefix is **not** applied in the case of
  ``$test_result/stdout`` and ``$test_result/stderr`` files, as one
  would expect.

* Test writers will get better protection against mistakes when trying
  to overwrite :class:`avocado.core.test.Test` "properties".  Some of
  those were previously implemented using
  :func:`avocado.utils.data_structures.LazyProperty` which did not
  prevent test writers from overwriting them.

* Avocado can now run list and run standard Python unittests, that is,
  tests written in Python that use the :mod:`unittest` library alone.

* Improvements in the serialization of TestIDs allow test result
  directories to be properly stored and accessed on Windows based
  filesystems.

* The complete output of tests, that is the combination of ``STDOUT``
  and ``STDERR`` is now also recorded in the test result directory as
  a file named ``output``.

* Support for listing and running golang tests has been introduced.
  Avocado can now discover tests written in Go, and if Go is properly
  installed, Avocado can run them.

* The support for test data files has been improved to support more
  specific sources of data.  For instance, when a test file used to
  contain more than one test, all of them shared the same ``datadir``
  property value, thus the same directory which contained data files.
  Now, tests should use the newly introduced :meth:`get_data()
  <avocado.core.test.TestData.get_data>` API, which will attempt to
  locate data files specific to the variant (if used), test name, and
  finally file name.  For more information, please refer to the
  section :ref:`accessing-test-data-files`.

* The output check feature will now use the to the most specific data
  source location available, which is a consequence of the switch to
  the use of the ``get_data()`` API discussed previously.  This means
  that two tests in a single file can generate different output,
  generate different ``stdout.expected`` or ``stderr.expected``.

* When the output check feature finds a mismatch between expected and
  actual output, will now produce a unified diff of those, instead of
  printing out their full content.  This makes it a lot easier to
  read the logs and quickly spot the differences and possibly the
  failure cause(s).

* Sysinfo collection can now be enabled on a test level basis.
