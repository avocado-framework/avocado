0.28.0 JÃ¡ra Cimrman, The Investigation of the Missing Class Register
====================================================================

This release basically polishes avocado, fixing a number of small usability
issues and bugs, and debuts avocado-vt as the official virt-test replacement!

Let's go with the changes from our last release, 0.27.0:

Changes in avocado:

* The avocado human output received another stream of tweaks and it's more
  compact, while still being informative. Here's an example::

    JOB ID     : f2f5060440bd57cba646c1f223ec8c40d03f539b
    JOB LOG : /home/user/avocado/job-results/job-2015-07-27T17.13-f2f5060/job.log
    TESTS      : 1
     (1/1) passtest.py:PassTest.test: PASS (0.00 s)
    RESULTS : PASS 1 | ERROR 0 | FAIL 0 | SKIP 0 | WARN 0 | INTERRUPT 0
    JOB HTML : /home/user/avocado/job-results/job-2015-07-27T17.13-f2f5060/html/results.html
    TIME       : 0.00 s

* The unittest system was completely revamped, paving the way for making
  avocado self-testable! Stay tuned for what we have on store.


* Many bugfixes. Check [1] for more details.

Changes in avocado-vt:

* The Spice Test provider has been separated from tp-qemu, and changes 
  reflected in avocado-vt [2].

* A number of bugfixes found by our contributors in the process of moving
  avocado-vt into the official virt-testing project. Check [3] for more
  details.

See you in a few weeks for our next release! Happy testing!
