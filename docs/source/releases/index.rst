How we release Avocado
======================

The regular releases are released after each sprint, which usually takes 3
weeks. Regular releases are supported only until the next version is released.

We also understand that there are multiple projects currently depending on the
stability of Avocado and we don't want their work to be disrupted by
incompatibilities nor instabilities in new releases.

Because of that, we have **LTS releases**, that are regular releases
considering the release cycle, but a new branch is created and bugfixes are
backported on demand for a period of about 18 months after the release. Every
year (or so) a new LTS version is released.  Two subsequent LTS versions are
guaranteed to have 6 months of supportability overlap.
