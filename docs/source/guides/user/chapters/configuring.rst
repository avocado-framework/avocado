Configuring
===========

Avocado utilities have a certain default behavior based on educated, reasonable
(we hope) guesses about how users like to use their systems. Of course,
different people will have different needs and/or dislike our defaults, and
that's why a configuration system is in place to help with those cases

The Avocado config file format is based on the (informal) `INI`_ file
specification, that is implemented by Python's  :mod:`configparser`. The format
is simple and straightforward, composed by `sections`, that contain a number of
`keys` and `values`. Take for example a basic Avocado config file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [datadir.paths]
    base_dir = /var/lib/avocado
    test_dir = /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests
    data_dir = /var/lib/avocado/data
    logs_dir = ~/avocado/job-results

The ``datadir.paths`` section contains a number of keys, all of them related to
directories used by the test runner. The ``base_dir`` is the base directory to
other important Avocado directories, such as log, data and test directories.
You can also choose to set those other important directories by means of the
variables ``test_dir``, ``data_dir`` and ``logs_dir``. You can do this by
simply editing the config files available.


Config file parsing order
-------------------------

Avocado starts by parsing what it calls system wide config file, that is
shipped to all Avocado users on a system wide directory,
``/etc/avocado/avocado.conf``. Then it'll verify if there's a local user config
file, that is located usually in ``~/.config/avocado/avocado.conf``. The order
of the parsing matters, so the system wide file is parsed, then the user config
file is parsed last, so that the user can override values at will. There is
another directory that will be scanned by extra config files,
``/etc/avocado/conf.d``. This directory may contain plugin config files, and
extra additional config files that the system administrator/avocado developers
might judge necessary to put there.

Please note that for base directories, if you chose a directory that can't be
properly used by Avocado (some directories require read access, others, read
and write access), Avocado will fall back to some defaults. So if your regular
user wants to write logs to ``/root/avocado/logs``, Avocado will not use that
directory, since it can't write files to that place. A new location, by default
``~/avocado/job-results`` will be selected instead.

The order of files described in this section is only valid if Avocado was
installed in the system. For people using Avocado from git repos (usually
Avocado developers), that did not install it in the system, keep in mind that
Avocado will read the config files present in the git repos, and will ignore
the system wide config files. Running ``avocado config`` will let you know
which files are actually being used.









Parsing order recap
-------------------

So the file parsing order is:

  * ``/etc/avocado/avocado.conf``
  * ``/etc/avocado/conf.d/*.conf``
  * ``avocado.plugins.settings`` plugins (but they can insert to any location)
  * ``~/.config/avocado/avocado.conf``

You can see the actual set of files/location by using ``avocado config`` which
uses ``*`` to mark existing and used files::

   $ avocado config
   Config files read (in order, '*' means the file exists and had been read):
    * /etc/avocado/avocado.conf
    * /etc/avocado/conf.d/resultsdb.conf
    * /etc/avocado/conf.d/result_upload.conf
    * /etc/avocado/conf.d/jobscripts.conf
    * /etc/avocado/conf.d/gdb.conf
    * /etc/avocado_vt/conf.d/vt.conf
    * /etc/avocado_vt/conf.d/vt_joblock.conf
      $HOME/.config/avocado/avocado.conf

    Section.Key                              Value
    datadir.paths.base_dir                   /var/lib/avocado
    datadir.paths.test_dir                   /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests
    ...

Where the lower config files override values of the upper files and the
``$HOME/.config/avocado/avocado.conf`` file missing.

.. note::  Please note that if Avocado is running from git repos, those files
  will be ignored in favor of in tree configuration files. This is something that
  would normally only affect people developing avocado, and if you are in doubt,
  ``avocado config`` will tell you exactly which files are being used in any
  given situation.

.. note::  When Avocado runs inside virtualenv than path for global config
  files is also changed. For example, `avocado.conf` comes from the virual-env
  path `venv/etc/avocado/avocado.conf`.


Order of precedence for values used in tests
--------------------------------------------

Since you can use the config system to alter behavior and values used in tests
(think paths to test programs, for example), we established the following order
of precedence for variables (from least precedence to most):

  * default value (from library or test code)
  * global config file
  * local (user) config file
  * command line switch
  * test parameters

So the least important value comes from the library or test code default, going
all the way up to the test parameters system.
