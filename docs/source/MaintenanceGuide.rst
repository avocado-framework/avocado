You can find on git such commits that will help you get oriented for other
repos.

Which repositories you should pay attention to
==============================================

In general, a release of avocado includes taking a look and eventually release
content in the following repositories:

* ``avocado``
* ``avocado-vt``

Tag all repositories
====================

When everything is in good shape, commit the version changes and tag
that commit in master with::

  $ git tag -u $(GPG_ID) -s $(RELEASE) -m 'Avocado Release $(RELEASE)'

Then the tag should be pushed to the GIT repository with::

  $ git push --tags

Build RPMs
==========

Go to the source directory and do::

    $ make rpm
    ...
    + exit 0

This should be all.  It will build packages using ``mock``, targeting
your default configuration.  That usually means the same platform
you're currently on.

Sign Packages
=============

All the packages should be signed for safer public consumption.  The
process is, of course, dependent on the private keys, put is based on
running::

  $ rpm --resign

For more information look at the ``rpmsign(8)`` man page.

Upload packages to repository
=============================

The current distribution method is based on serving content over HTTP.
That means that repository metadata is created locally and
synchronized to the well know public Web server.  A process similar
to::

  $ cd $REPO_ROOT && for DIR in epel-?-noarch fedora-??-noarch; \
  do cd $DIR && createrepo -v . && cd ..; done;

Creates the repo metadata locally.  Then a command similar to::

  $ rsync -va $REPO_ROOT user@repo_web_server:/path

Is used to copy the content over.


Write release notes
===================

Release notes give an idea of what has changed on a given development
cycle.  Good places to go for release notes are:

1) Git logs
2) Trello Cards (Look for the Done lists)
3) Github compare views: https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado/compare/0.28.0...0.29.0

Go there and try to write a text that represents the changes that the
release encompasses.

Upload package to PyPI
======================

Users may also want to get Avocado from the PyPI repository, so please upload
there as well.  To help with the process, please run::

 $ make pypi

And follow the URL and brief instructions given.

Configure Read The Docs
=======================

On https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/avocado-framework/edit/:

 - Click in **Versions**. In **Choose Active Versions**, find the version
   you're releasing and check the **Active** option. **Submit**.
 - Click in **Versions** again. In **Default Version**, select the new
   version you're releasing. **Submit**.

Send e-mails to avocado-devel and other places
==============================================

Send the e-mail with the release notes to avocado-devel and
virt-test-devel.
