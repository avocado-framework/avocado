TL;DR
*****

Having better records of architectural decisions in our repository is a good
way to socialize our technical decisions, improve the code review process,
avoid unnecessary code, and balance the workload among other developers. We are
already using the “blueprint” documents for a while and still learning how to
write them. Although we have a basic idea of what is a blueprint, some may not
understand the concept because we are missing one meta-document that describes
the blueprint's basic notions. This document is a blueprint to specify how we
should write blueprints from now on.

Motivation
**********

Depending on the project size, having very well defined and structured
documents about the architecture decisions seems like overkill, but could help
projects of any size, including Avocado, save time, make better decisions and
improve the way we socialize those decisions.

Today in the Avocado project we have the good practice to submit an RFC to
our mailing list or to use/open a GitHub issue when we have a new idea. RFCs are a
widespread way to disclose the architecture decisions, but they are just one
part of a longer process. During the RFC phase, we argue in favor of a
proposal, and we are mostly concerned about collecting feedback. After this
phase, we could go one step forward and consolidate the discussion in
Blueprints (sometimes called ADRs - Architecture Decision Records). This could
be the next step so we could better socialize our decisions for future readers.
A very well defined and structured document has some advantages over an RFC,
but it is not intended to replace it.

With blueprints, we could not only, but mainly:

  * Create better documents for future members and future reference, when we
    are trying to answer those questions:

a) *why* are you doing this? (the “problem” or the “motivation”);
b) *what* are you proposing to solve the problem? (your solution)?
c) And *how* are you going to implement the proposed solution?

Depending on the type of your blueprint, the answer for the last question (c)
could be written in pseudocode, general text or even not necessary (although
desired) — more details on the section named Specification.

  * Make sure that another peer will be able to implement a feature/requirement.

Blueprints are not for you; they are for the community. If you know that a
problem exists and know how to fix it, the most natural course of action would
be to start coding this fix and submitting a Pull Request. While this is still
valid for most of the cases, some important architectural changes must be
discussed first to explain the “why”, “what” and “how” to keep everyone on the
same page, avoid unnecessary coding, and most importantly: allow others to
implement it in case you are not available.

  * Improve the code review quality and time.

Having a better understanding of the problem and the big picture is better for
code review. It is harder to capture that from the Pull Request (PR)
description and PR changes. Developers that are aware of the problem tend to
review your changes with the problem in mind and hence more quickly. 

  * Reduce onboarding time for new members.

Having a history of how we made an architectural decision and why we are
implementing it this way will give new members reading material to understand
our project, avoiding unnecessary discussions and meetings to explain
something.

  * Create a common standard that will make it easier for readers.

With an open RFC, authors tend to organize the ideas in different ways with
different sections. Having a very well structured document with common sections
will make it easier for readers to understand the problem and the solution.

  * Track the progress of a significant implementation.

We could use the blueprints header “status” line to track the progress of some
features. We could even have a page parsing and listing all the blueprints with
the title, author, status, and target milestone for that feature.

  * Find the middle ground between “overthinking” and “auto-pilot.”

Last but not least: we are *not trying* to overthink here and/or slow down our
development processes. The idea is to have a lightweight document, very
objective that will save us time in the medium and long run. We don’t have to
overthink by trying to handle any possible scenario outside of ones we actually
have a use case for. But we should also avoid the “auto-pilot” mode in our
contributions.


Specification
*************

One blueprint per topic
-----------------------

Try to follow the minimalist approach and be concise with content relevant to
one particular topic. If you have a more general topic to discuss, you should
set the type as “Epic Blueprint” (more below) but still try to be concise and
focused on the subject.

File format and location
------------------------

Our current documentation already uses ReStructuredText (.rst) format, so we
will adopt .rst format here too. All blueprints will be located inside
`docs/source/blueprints` with the filename `BPXXX.rst`, where XXX is the number
of the blueprint. Just pick the next number available for your blueprint.

Write for your audience
-----------------------

As mentioned before, your blueprint will be read by your peers, future members,
and future yourself. Keep in mind that your audience is developers with a
minimal understanding of the Avocado internals, but also be gentle and provide
any context to understand the problem.

Blueprints types
----------------

Currently, we have the following blueprint types:

 * Architectural Blueprint: Any blueprint changing or introducing a new core
   feature or architectural change to Avocado.

 * Process Blueprint: Any blueprint that is not implementing a new core
   feature, but changing how the project works. This could be, for instance,
   related to the repositories or processes.

 * Meta Blueprint: A blueprint about blueprints. Like this one and any future
   blueprint that changes our blueprint's styles and methods.

 * Epic Blueprint: A blueprint that is touching on multiple areas and is too
   big to have all the documentation in one single blueprint. We could split
   epic blueprints into smaller blueprints or issues (if they are small and
   easy to understand).

 * Component Blueprint: A blueprint with the intent to describe a new utility
   module or a new plugin.

Headers
-------

Python PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals) uses RFC822 for describing the
headers. This could be useful here too, especially when parsing those headers
to display our list of blueprints with the current status.

The current list of items of our blueprint headers is below:

 * Number: Usually, the blueprint number in the format BPXXX

 * Title: A short descriptive title, limited to 80 characters

 * Author: The author or authors of blueprint

 * Reviewers: All reviewers that approved and helped during the review process

 * Created: Date string when the blueprint first draft was submitted. Please
   use the following format: DD-MMM-YYYY.

 * Type: One of the types described during the previous section

 * Status: One of the types described during the next section

Here is an example of a header::

   :Number: BP001

   :Reviewers: Cleber Rosa, Lukáš Doktor and Plamen Dimitrov
   :Created: 06-Dec-2019
   :Type: Epic Blueprint
   :Status: WIP

Blueprint statuses
------------------

 * Draft: All blueprints should be created in this state. This means the
   blueprint is accepting comments, and probably there is a discussion
   happening. Blueprints in draft mode can be part of our repository.

 * Approved: Blueprint was approved after discussions, and all suggestions are
   already incorporated on the document. Nobody has started working on this
   yet.

 * Assigned: This status is not about the blueprint itself, but about the proposal
   that is the subject of the BP. This means that the blueprint was approved,
   and someone is already working on implementing it. A BP status can change
   from Draft to Assigned if the work has started already.

 * Implemented: This means the BP is already implemented and delivered to the
   Avocado’s master branch.

 * Rejected: Rejected status means the idea was not implemented because it
   wasn't approved by everyone or has some techinical limitations.

 * Deprecated: Deprecated means it was approved, implemented, and at some
   point, makes no more sense to have it. For example, anything related to the
   legacy runner. Usually, Deprecated means that it was replaced by something
   else.

As you can see, there is no status to accommodate any future change in a
blueprint. Blueprints should not be “voided.” Any improvement on an old
blueprint should be presented as a new blueprint, changing the status of the
original to “deprecated”.

Sections
--------

In order to facilitate the reading and understanding of the problem, all
blueprints must have the following sections:

 * TL;DR

 * Motivation

 * Specification

 * Backwards Compatibility

 * Security Implications

 * How to Teach This

 * Related Issues

 * References

Bellow a brief description of what you should write in each section:

 * TL;DR: Should be a short description of your blueprint. Like an abstract. We
   recommend writing this at the end of your first draft. This will give you a
   better overview of it.

 * Motivation: This should be the motivation of your proposed solution, not the
   motivation of the blueprint itself. It describes the problem. Here, the
   proposed solution should answer “why” this is needed.

 * Specification: In this section, you should describe how you are going to
   solve the problem. You can create subsections here to organize your ideas
   better. Please keep in mind that it is useful to mention the details, with
   code snippets, examples, and/or references. This will save you time, making
   sure that everyone is in agreement with the proposed solution.

 * Backwards Compatibility: How is your proposal going to affect older versions
   of Avocado? Should we deprecate some modules, classes, or methods? Are we
   going to keep backwards compatibility or not?

 * Security Implications: Do you have any concerns about security with your
   proposed solution and what are they?

 * How to Teach This: What is the best way to teach our devs and users your new
   feature/solution?

 * Related Issues: Here, you should mention Github links for both: a) current
   open issues that are blocking while waiting for your BP and b) all open
   issues that will render this BP as “implemented” when closed.

   * Issues to address this BP

   * Issues this BP will solve

 * References: Any external reference for helping understand the problem and
   your solution.

Backwards Compatibility
***********************

So far, we are on our 3rth blueprint (BP003 was the last one). This BP000
should have been released before those blueprints. So probably those three
blueprints are not 100% compliance with this meta blueprint, and that is fine.
We were learning on the fly. We don’t need to change any of those blueprints
after BP000 gets approved.

Security Implications
*********************

No security implications found so far.

How to Teach This
*****************

Getting used to writing blueprints is not an easy task. And probably we are
going to find non-planned issues with this process on the way.  The general
rule of thumb is to use common sense. To make this more public, we could
consider the following:

 * If approved, BP000 should be on top of our blueprints lists for reference.

 * We could also have a template inside the `blueprints` directory to help
   people when submitting their own blueprints.

 * Also, we could include pointers and instructions in our development guide
   for this BP.

 * Another good practice would be to make comments in Avocado’s source code
   with some pointers to specific blueprints.
