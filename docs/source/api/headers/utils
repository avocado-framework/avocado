Avocado gives to you more than 40 python utility libraries (so far), that can
be found under the :mod:`avocado.utils`. You can use these libraries to avoid
having to write necessary routines for your tests. These are very general in
nature and can help you speed up your test development.

The utility libraries may receive incompatible changes across minor versions,
but these will be done in a staged fashion. If a given change to an utility
library can cause test breakage, it will first be documented and/or deprecated,
and only on the next subsequent minor version, it will actually be changed.

What this means is that upon updating to later minor versions of Avocado, you
should look at the Avocado Release Notes for changes that may impact your
tests.

This is a set of utility APIs that Avocado provides as added value to test
writers. It's suppose to be generic, without any knowledge of Avocado and
reusable in different projects.
