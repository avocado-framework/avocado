    Transforms resolver resolutions into tasks

    A resolver resolution
    (:class:`avocado.core.resolver.ReferenceResolution`) contains
    information about the resolution process (if it was successful
    or not) and in case of successful resolutions a list of
    resolutions.  It's expected that the resolution are
    :class:`avocado.core.nrunner.Runnable`.

    This method transforms those runnables into Tasks
    (:class:`avocado.core.nrunner.Task`), which will include a status
    reporting URI.  It also performs tag based filtering on the
    runnables for possibly excluding some of the Runnables.

                        references
