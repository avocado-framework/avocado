"""
Diff validator: Utility for testing file changes

Some typical use of this utility would be:

>>> import diff_validator
>>> change = diff_validator.Change()
>>> change.add_validated_files(["/etc/somerc"])
>>> change.append_expected_add("/etc/somerc", "this is a new line")
>>> change.append_expected_remove("/etc/somerc", "this line is removed")
>>> diff_validator.make_temp_file_copies(change.get_target_files())

After making changes through some in-test operation:

>>> changes = diff_validator.extract_changes(change.get_target_files())
>>> change_success = diff_validator.assert_change(changes, change.files_dict)

If test fails due to invalid change on the system:

>>> if not change_success:
>>>     changes = diff_validator.assert_change_dict(changes, change.files_dict)
>>>     raise DiffValidationError("Change is different than expected:\n%s" % diff_validator.create_diff_report(changes))
>>> else:
>>>     logging.info("Change made successfully")
>>> diff_validator.del_temp_file_copies(change.get_target_files())
