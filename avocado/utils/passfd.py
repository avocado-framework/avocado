'''
passfd.py: Python library to pass file descriptors across UNIX domain sockets

This simple extension provides two functions to pass and receive file
descriptors across UNIX domain sockets, using the BSD-4.3+ sendmsg() and
recvmsg() interfaces.

Direct bindings to sendmsg and recvmsg are not provided, as the API does
not map nicely into Python.

Please note that this only supports BSD-4.3+ style file descriptor
passing, and was only tested on Linux. Patches are welcomed!

For more information, see one of the R. Stevens' books:
 - Richard Stevens: Unix Network Programming, Prentice Hall, 1990;
   chapter 6.10

 - Richard Stevens: Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment,
   Addison-Wesley, 1993; chapter 15.3
