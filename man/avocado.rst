SYNOPSIS
========

avocado [-h] [-v] [--config [CONFIG_FILE]] [--show [STREAM[:LVL]]] [-s]
 {config,diff,distro,exec-path,list,multiplex,plugins,run,sysinfo} ...

DESCRIPTION
===========

Avocado is a modern test framework that is built on the experience
accumulated with `autotest` (https://autotest.github.io).

`avocado` is also the name of its test runner command line tool,
described in this man page.

For more information about the Avocado project, please check its
website: https://avocado-framework.github.io/

OPTIONS
=======

The following list of options are builtin, application level `avocado`
options. Most other options are implemented via plugins and will depend
on them being loaded (`avocado --help`)::

    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
    --config [CONFIG_FILE]
                          Use custom configuration from a file
    --enable-paginator    Turn the paginator on. Useful when output is too long.
    -V, --verbose         Some commands can produce more information. This
                          option will enable the verbosity when applicable.
    --show CORE.SHOW      List of comma separated builtin logs, or logging
                          streams optionally followed by LEVEL (DEBUG,INFO,...).
                          Builtin streams are: "app": application output;
                          "test": test output; "debug": tracebacks and other
                          debugging info; "early": early logging of other
                          streams, including test (very verbose); "all": all
                          builtin streams; "none": disables regular output
                          (leaving only errors enabled). By default: 'app'

Real use of avocado depends on running avocado subcommands. This a
typical list of avocado subcommands::

    assets              Manage assets
    config              Shows avocado config keys
    diff                Shows the difference between 2 jobs.
    distro              Shows detected Linux distribution
    exec-path           Returns path to avocado bash libraries and exits.
    jobs                Manage Avocado jobs
    list                List available tests
    plugins             Displays plugin information
    replay              Runs a new job using a previous job as its
                        configuration
    run                 Runs one or more tests (native test, test alias,
                        binary or script)
    sysinfo             Collect system information
    variants            Tool to analyze and visualize test variants and params
    vmimage             Provides VM images acquired from official repositories


To get usage instructions for a given subcommand, run it with `--help`.
Example::

    $ avocado run --help

Options for subcommand `run` (`avocado run --help`)::

    positional arguments:
      TEST_REFERENCE        List of test references (aliases or paths)

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -p NAME_VALUE, --test-parameter NAME_VALUE
                            Parameter name and value to pass to all tests. This is
                            only applicable when not using a varianter plugin.
                            This option format must be given in the NAME=VALUE
                            format, and may be given any number of times, or per
                            parameter.
      --test-runner TEST_RUNNER
                            Selects the runner implementation from one of the
                            installed and active implementations. You can run
                            "avocado plugins" and find the list of valid runners
                            under the "Plugins that run test suites on a job
                            (runners) section. Defaults to "nrunner", which is the
                            new runner. To use the conventional and traditional
                            runner, use "runner".
      -d, --dry-run         Instead of running the test only list them and log
                            their params.
      --dry-run-no-cleanup  Do not automatically clean up temporary directories
                            used by dry-run
      --force-job-id UNIQUE_JOB_ID
                            Forces the use of a particular job ID. Used internally
                            when interacting with an avocado server. You should
                            not use this option unless you know exactly what
                            you're doing
      --job-results-dir DIRECTORY
                            Forces to use of an alternate job results directory.
      --job-category CATEGORY
                            Categorizes this within a directory with the same
                            name, by creating a link to the job result directory
      --job-timeout SECONDS
                            Set the maximum amount of time (in SECONDS) that tests
                            are allowed to execute. Values <= zero means "no
                            timeout". You can also use suffixes, like: s
                            (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours).
      --failfast            Enable the job interruption on first failed test.
      --keep-tmp            Keep job temporary files (useful for avocado
                            debugging).
      --ignore-missing-references
                            Force the job execution, even if some of the test
                            references are not resolved to tests. "on" and "off"
                            will be deprecated soon.
      --disable-sysinfo     Enable or disable sysinfo information. Like hardware
                            details, profiles, etc.
      --execution-order RUN.EXECUTION_ORDER
                            Defines the order of iterating through test suite and
                            test variants
      --log-test-data-directories
                            Logs the possible data directories for each test. This
                            is helpful when writing new tests and not being sure
                            where to put data files. Look for "Test data
                            directories" in your test log
      --journal             Records test status changes (for use with avocado-
                            journal-replay and avocado-server)
      --json FILE           Enable JSON result format and write it to FILE. Use
                            "-" to redirect to the standard output.
      --disable-json-job-result
                            Enables default JSON result in the job results
                            directory. File will be named "results.json".
      --tap FILE            Enable TAP result output and write it to FILE. Use "-"
                            to redirect to standard output.
      --disable-tap-job-result
                            Enables default TAP result in the job results
                            directory. File will be named "results.tap"
      --tap-include-logs    Include test logs as comments in TAP output.
      -z, --archive         Archive (ZIP) files generated by tests

    output and result format:
      --store-logging-stream LOGGING_STREAM
                            Store given logging STREAMs in
                            "$JOB_RESULTS_DIR/$STREAM.$LEVEL."
      --xunit FILE          Enable xUnit result format and write it to FILE. Use
                            "-" to redirect to the standard output.
      --disable-xunit-job-result
                            Enables default xUnit result in the job results
                            directory. File will be named "results.xml".
      --xunit-job-name XUNIT_JOB_NAME
                            Override the reported job name. By default uses the
                            Avocado job name which is always unique. This is
                            useful for reporting in Jenkins as it only evaluates
                            first-failure from jobs of the same name.
      --xunit-max-test-log-chars SIZE
                            Limit the attached job log to given number of
                            characters (k/m/g suffix allowed)

    output check arguments:
      --output-check-record {none,stdout,stderr,both,combined,all}
                            Record the output produced by each test (from stdout
                            and stderr) into both the current executing result and
                            into reference files. Reference files are used on
                            subsequent runs to determine if the test produced the
                            expected output or not, and the current executing
                            result is used to check against a previously recorded
                            reference file. Valid values: "none" (to explicitly
                            disable all recording) "stdout" (to record standard
                            output *only*), "stderr" (to record standard error
                            *only*), "both" (to record standard output and error
                            in separate files), "combined" (for standard output
                            and error in a single file). "all" is also a valid but
                            deprecated option that is a synonym of "both".
      --disable-output-check
                            Disables test output (stdout/stderr) check. If this
                            option is given, no output will be checked, even if
                            there are reference files present for the test.

    loader options:
      --loaders LOADER_NAME_OR_TEST_TYPE [LOADER_NAME_OR_TEST_TYPE ...]
                            Overrides the priority of the test loaders. You can
                            specify either @loader_name or TEST_TYPE. By default
                            it tries all available loaders according to priority
                            set in settings->plugins.loaders.
      --external-runner EXTERNAL_RUNNER
                            Path to an specific test runner that allows the use of
                            its own tests. This should be used for running tests
                            that do not conform to Avocado's SIMPLE test interface
                            and can not run standalone. Note: the use of
                            --external-runner overwrites the --loaders to
                            'external_runner'
      --external-runner-chdir {runner,test}
                            Change directory before executing tests. This option
                            may be necessary because of requirements and/or
                            limitations of the external test runner. If the
                            external runner requires to be run from its own base
                            directory, use 'runner' here. If the external runner
                            runs tests based on files and requires to be run from
                            the directory where those files are located, use
                            'test' here and specify the test directory with the
                            option '--external-runner-testdir'.
      --external-runner-testdir DIRECTORY
                            Where test files understood by the external test
                            runner are located in the filesystem. Obviously this
                            assumes and only applies to external test runners that
                            run tests from files

    filtering parameters:
      -t TAGS, --filter-by-tags TAGS
                            Filter tests based on tags
      --filter-by-tags-include-empty
                            Include all tests without tags during filtering. This
                            effectively means they will be kept in the test suite
                            found previously to filtering.
      --filter-by-tags-include-empty-key
                            Include all tests that do not have a matching key in
                            its key:val tags. This effectively means those tests
                            will be kept in the test suite found previously to
                            filtering.

    JSON serialized based varianter options:
      --json-variants-load FILE
                            Load the Variants from a JSON serialized file

    nrunner specific options:
      --nrunner-shuffle     Shuffle the tasks to be executed
      --nrunner-status-server-listen HOST_PORT
                            URI for listing the status server. Usually a
                            "HOST:PORT" string
      --nrunner-status-server-uri HOST_PORT
                            URI for connecting to the status server, usually a
                            "HOST:PORT" string. Use this if your status server is
                            in another host, or different port
      --nrunner-max-parallel-tasks NUMBER_OF_TASKS
                            Number of maximum number tasks running in parallel.
                            You can disable parallel execution by setting this to
                            1. Defaults to the amount of CPUs on this machine.
      --nrunner-spawner SPAWNER
                            Spawn tasks in a specific spawner. Available spawners:
                            'process' and 'podman'

    podman spawner specific options:
      --spawner-podman-bin PODMAN_BIN
                            Path to the podman binary
      --spawner-podman-image CONTAINER_IMAGE
                            Image name to use when creating the container

    job replay:
      --replay JOB_ID       Replay a job identified by its (partial) hash id. Use
                            "--replay" latest to replay the latest job.
      --replay-test-status TEST_STATUS
                            Filter tests to replay by test status.
      --replay-ignore IGNORE
                            Ignore variants and/or configuration from the source
                            job.
      --replay-resume       Resume an interrupted job

    wrapper support:
      --wrapper SCRIPT[:EXECUTABLE]
                            Use a script to wrap executables run by a test. The
                            wrapper is either a path to a script (AKA a global
                            wrapper) or a path to a script followed by colon
                            symbol (:), plus a shell like glob to the target
                            EXECUTABLE. Multiple wrapper options are allowed, but
                            only one global wrapper can be defined.

                            other test loader plugins active, tests from those
                            plugins might also show up (behavior may vary among
                            plugins)

      --resolver            Uses the Avocado resolver method (part of the nrunner
                            architecture) to detect tests. This is enabled by
                            default and exists only for compatibility purposes,
                            and will be removed soon. To use the legacy (loader)
                            method for finding tests, set the "--loader" option
      --loader              Uses the Avocado legacy (loader) method for finding
                            tests. This option will exist only for a transitional
                            period until the legacy (loader) method is deprecated
                            and removed
      --write-recipes-to-directory DIRECTORY
                            Writes runnable recipe files to a directory. Valid
                            only when using --resolver.
      --json JSON_FILE      Writes output to a json file.

    loader options:
      --loaders LOADER_NAME_OR_TEST_TYPE [LOADER_NAME_OR_TEST_TYPE ...]
                            Overrides the priority of the test loaders. You can
                            specify either @loader_name or TEST_TYPE. By default
                            it tries all available loaders according to priority
                            set in settings->plugins.loaders.
      --external-runner EXTERNAL_RUNNER
                            Path to an specific test runner that allows the use of
                            its own tests. This should be used for running tests
                            that do not conform to Avocado's SIMPLE test interface
                            and can not run standalone. Note: the use of
                            --external-runner overwrites the --loaders to
                            'external_runner'
      --external-runner-chdir {runner,test}
                            Change directory before executing tests. This option
                            may be necessary because of requirements and/or
                            limitations of the external test runner. If the
                            external runner requires to be run from its own base
                            directory, use 'runner' here. If the external runner
                            runs tests based on files and requires to be run from
                            the directory where those files are located, use
                            'test' here and specify the test directory with the
                            option '--external-runner-testdir'.
      --external-runner-testdir DIRECTORY
                            Where test files understood by the external test
                            runner are located in the filesystem. Obviously this
                            assumes and only applies to external test runners that
                            run tests from files

    filtering parameters:
      -t TAGS, --filter-by-tags TAGS
                            Filter tests based on tags
      --filter-by-tags-include-empty
                            Include all tests without tags during filtering. This
                            effectively means they will be kept in the test suite
                            found previously to filtering.
      --filter-by-tags-include-empty-key
                            Include all tests that do not have a matching key in
                            its key:val tags. This effectively means those tests
                            will be kept in the test suite found previously to
                            filtering.

RUNNING A TEST
==============

The most common use of the `avocado` command line tool is to run a
test::

    $ avocado run examples/tests/sleeptest.py

This command will run the `sleeptest.py` test, as found on the standard
test directories. The output should be similar to::

    JOB ID    : <id>
    JOB LOG   : /home/user/avocado/job-results/job-<date>-<shortid>/job.log
     (1/1) sleeptest.py:SleepTest.test: PASS (1.01 s)
    RESULTS    : PASS 1 | ERROR 0 | FAIL 0 | SKIP 0 | WARN 0 | INTERRUPT 0 | CANCEL 0
    JOB TIME   : 1.11 s

The test directories will vary depending on you system and installation
method used. Still, it's pretty easy to find that out as shown in the
next section.

DEBUGGING TESTS
===============

When you are developing new tests, frequently you want to look at the
straight output of the job log in the stdout, without having to tail the
job log. In order to do that, you can use `--show=test` to the avocado
test runner::

    $ avocado --show=test run examples/tests/sleeptest.py
    ...
    PARAMS (key=timeout, path=*, default=None) => None
    Test metadata:
      filename: /home/user/avocado/examples/tests/sleeptest.py
      teststmpdir: /var/tmp/avocado_o98elmi0
      workdir: /var/tmp/avocado_iyzcj3hn/avocado_job_mwikfsnl/1-examples_tests_sleeptest.py_SleepTest.test
    START 1-examples/tests/sleeptest.py:SleepTest.test
    DATA (filename=output.expected) => NOT FOUND (data sources: variant, test, file)
    PARAMS (key=sleep_length, path=*, default=1) => 1
    Sleeping for 1.00 seconds
    DATA (filename=output.expected) => NOT FOUND (data sources: variant, test, file)
    DATA (filename=stdout.expected) => NOT FOUND (data sources: variant, test, file)
    DATA (filename=stderr.expected) => NOT FOUND (data sources: variant, test, file)
    PASS 1-examples/tests/sleeptest.py:SleepTest.test
    ...

Let's say you are debugging a test particularly large, with lots of
debug output and you want to reduce this output to only messages with
level 'INFO' and higher. You can set job-log-level to info to reduce the
amount of output.

Edit your `~/.config/avocado/avocado.conf` file and add::

    [job.output]
    loglevel = INFO

Running the same example with this option will give you::

    $ avocado --show=test run examples/tests/sleeptest.py
    ...
    START 1-examples/tests/sleeptest.py:SleepTest.test
    PASS 1-examples/tests/sleeptest.py:SleepTest.test
    ...

The levels you can choose are the levels available in the python logging
system `https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels`,
so 'NOTSET', 'DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR', 'CRITICAL', in order
of severity.

As you can see, the UI output is suppressed and only the job log goes to
stdout, making this a useful feature for test development/debugging.

SILENCING RUNNER STDOUT
=======================

You may specify `--show=none`, that means avocado will turn off all
runner stdout.  Note that `--show=none` does not affect on disk
job logs, those continue to be generated normally.

SILENCING SYSINFO REPORT
========================

You may specify `--disable-sysinfo` and avocado will not collect profilers,
hardware details and other system information, inside the job result
directory.

LISTING TESTS
=============

The `avocado` command line tool also has a `list` command, that lists
the known tests in a given path, be it a path to an individual test, or
a path to a directory. If no arguments provided, avocado will inspect
the contents of the test location being used by avocado (if you are in
doubt about which one is that, you may use `avocado config --datadir`).
The output looks like::

    $ avocado list
    INSTRUMENTED /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests/abort.py
    INSTRUMENTED /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests/datadir.py
    INSTRUMENTED /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests/doublefail.py
    INSTRUMENTED /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests/doublefree.py
    INSTRUMENTED /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests/errortest.py
    INSTRUMENTED /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests/failtest.py
    INSTRUMENTED /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests/fiotest.py
    INSTRUMENTED /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests/gdbtest.py
    INSTRUMENTED /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests/gendata.py
    INSTRUMENTED /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests/linuxbuild.py
    INSTRUMENTED /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests/multiplextest.py
    INSTRUMENTED /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests/passtest.py
    INSTRUMENTED /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests/skiptest.py
    INSTRUMENTED /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests/sleeptenmin.py
    INSTRUMENTED /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests/sleeptest.py
    INSTRUMENTED /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests/synctest.py
    INSTRUMENTED /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests/timeouttest.py
    INSTRUMENTED /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests/warntest.py
    INSTRUMENTED /usr/share/doc/avocado/tests/whiteboard.py

Here, `INSTRUMENTED` means that the files there are python files with an
avocado test class in them, therefore, that they are what we call
instrumented tests. This means those tests can use all avocado APIs and
facilities. Let's try to list a directory with a bunch of executable
shell scripts::

    $ avocado list examples/wrappers/
    SIMPLE examples/wrappers/bind_cpu0.sh
    SIMPLE examples/wrappers/dummy.sh
    SIMPLE examples/wrappers/ltrace.sh
    SIMPLE examples/wrappers/perf.sh
    SIMPLE examples/wrappers/rr.sh
    SIMPLE examples/wrappers/strace.sh
    SIMPLE examples/wrappers/time.sh
    SIMPLE examples/wrappers/valgrind.sh

Here, `SIMPLE` means that those files are executables, that avocado will
simply execute and return PASS or FAIL depending on their return codes
(PASS -> 0, FAIL -> any integer different than 0). You can also provide
the `--verbose`, or `-V` flag to display files that were detected but
are not avocado tests, along with summary information::

    $ avocado -V list examples/gdb-prerun-scripts/
    Type       Test                                     Tag(s)
    NOT_A_TEST examples/gdb-prerun-scripts/README
    NOT_A_TEST examples/gdb-prerun-scripts/pass-sigusr1

    TEST TYPES SUMMARY
    ==================
    not_a_test: 2

That summarizes the basic commands you should be using more frequently
when you start with avocado. Let's talk now about how avocado stores
test results.

EXPLORING RESULTS
=================

When `avocado` runs tests, it saves all its results on your system::

    JOB ID    : <id>
    JOB LOG   : /home/user/avocado/job-results/job-<date>-<shortid>/job.log

For your convenience, `avocado` maintains a link to the latest job run
(an `avocado run` command in this context), so you can always use
`"latest"` to browse your test results::

    $ ls /home/user/avocado/job-results/latest
    id
    jobdata
    job.log
    results.html
    results.json
    results.tap
    results.xml
    sysinfo
    test-results

The main log file is `job.log`, but every test has its own results
directory::

    $ ls -1 ~/avocado/job-results/latest/test-results/
    1-sleeptest.py:SleepTest.test

Since this is a directory, it should have content similar to::

    $ ls -1 ~/avocado/job-results/latest/test-results/1-sleeptest.py\:SleepTest.test/
    data
    debug.log
    stderr
    stdout
    whiteboard

MULTIPLEX FILE
==============

Avocado has a powerful tool that enables multiple test scenarios to be
run using a single, unmodified test. This mechanism uses a YAML file
called the 'multiplex file', that tells avocado how to multiply all
possible test scenarios automatically.

This is a sample that varies the parameter `sleep_length` through the
scenarios ``/run/short`` (sleeps for 0.5 s), ``/run/medium`` (sleeps for
1 s), ``/run/long`` (sleeps for 5s), ``/run/longest`` (sleeps for 10s).
The YAML file (multiplex file) that produced the output above is::

    !mux
    short:
        sleep_length: 0.5
    medium:
        sleep_length: 1
    long:
        sleep_length: 5
    longest:
        sleep_length: 10

You can execute `sleeptest` in all variations exposed above with::

    $ avocado run examples/tests/sleeptest.py -m examples/tests/sleeptest.py.data/sleeptest.yaml

And the output should look like::

    JOB ID    : <id>
    JOB LOG   : /home/user/avocado/job-results/job-<date>-<shortid>/job.log
     (1/4) examples/tests/sleeptest.py:SleepTest.test;run-short-beaf: PASS (0.50 s)
     (2/4) examples/tests/sleeptest.py:SleepTest.test;run-medium-5595: PASS (1.01 s)
     (3/4) examples/tests/sleeptest.py:SleepTest.test;run-long-f397: PASS (5.01 s)
     (4/4) examples/tests/sleeptest.py:SleepTest.test;run-longest-efc4: PASS (10.01 s)
    RESULTS    : PASS 4 | ERROR 0 | FAIL 0 | SKIP 0 | WARN 0 | INTERRUPT 0 | CANCEL 0
    JOB TIME   : 16.65 s

The test runner supports two kinds of global filters, through the command
line options `--mux-filter-only` and `--mux-filter-out`.
The `mux-filter-only` exclusively includes one or more paths and the
`mux-filter-out` removes one or more paths from being processed.

From the previous example, if we are interested to use the variants
`/run/medium` and `/run/longest`, we do the following command line::

    $ avocado run examples/tests/sleeptest.py -m examples/tests/sleeptest.py.data/sleeptest.yaml \
          --mux-filter-only /run/medium /run/longest

And if you want to remove `/small` from the variants created,
we do the following::

    $ avocado run examples/tests/sleeptest.py -m examples/tests/sleeptest.py.data/sleeptest.yaml \
          --mux-filter-out /run/medium

Note that both `--mux-filter-only` and `--mux-filter-out` filters can be
arranged in the same command line.

The multiplexer also supports default paths. The base path is ``/run/*``
but it can be overridden by ``--mux-path``, which accepts multiple
arguments. What it does: it splits leaves by the provided paths. Each
query goes one by one through those sub-trees and first one to hit the
match returns the result. It might not solve all problems, but it can
help to combine existing YAML files with your ones::

    qa: # large and complex read-only file, content injected into /qa
        tests:
            timeout: 10
        ...
    my_variants: !mux # your YAML file injected into /my_variants
        short:
            timeout: 1
        long:
            timeout: 1000

You want to use an existing test which uses
``params.get('timeout', '*')``.  Then you can use
``--mux-path '/my_variants/*' '/qa/*'`` and it'll first look in your
variants. If no matches are found, then it would proceed to ``/qa/*``

Keep in mind that only slices defined in mux-path are taken into account
for relative paths (the ones starting with ``*``).


WRAP EXECUTABLE RUN BY TESTS
============================

Avocado allows the instrumentation of executables being run by a test
in a transparent way. The user specifies a script ("the wrapper") to be
used to run the actual program called by the test.

If the instrumentation script is implemented correctly, it should not
interfere with the test behavior. That is, the wrapper should avoid
changing the return status, standard output and standard error messages
of the original executable.

The user can be specific about which program to wrap (with a shell-like
glob), or if that is omitted, a global wrapper that will apply to all
programs called by the test.

So, for every executable run by the test, the program name will be
compared to the pattern to decide whether to wrap it or not. You can
have multiples wrappers and patterns defined.

Examples::

    $ avocado run examples/tests/datadir.py --wrapper examples/wrappers/strace.sh

Any command created by the test datadir will be wrapped on
``strace.sh``. ::

    $ avocado run examples/tests/datadir.py \
            --wrapper examples/wrappers/ltrace.sh:*make \
            --wrapper examples/wrappers/perf.sh:*datadir

Any command that matches the pattern `*make` will be wrapper on
``ltrace.sh`` and the pattern ``*datadir`` will trigger the execution of
``perf.sh``.

RUNNING TESTS WITH AN EXTERNAL RUNNER
=====================================

It's quite common to have organically grown test suites in most
software projects. These usually include a custom built, very specific
test runner that knows how to find and run their own tests.

Still, running those tests inside Avocado may be a good idea for
various reasons, including being able to have results in different
human and machine readable formats, collecting system information
alongside those tests (the Avocado's `sysinfo` functionality), and
more.

Avocado makes that possible by means of its "external runner" feature.
The most basic way of using it is::

    $ avocado run --external-runner=/path/to/external_runner foo bar baz

In this example, Avocado will report individual test results for tests
`foo`, `bar` and `baz`. The actual results will be based on the return
code of individual executions of `/path/to/external_runner foo`,
`/path/to/external_runner bar` and finally
`/path/to/external_runner baz`.

As another way to explain an show how this feature works, think of the
"external runner" as some kind of interpreter and the individual tests
as anything that this interpreter recognizes and is able to execute. A
UNIX shell, say `/bin/sh` could be considered an external runner, and
files with shell code could be considered tests::

    $ echo "exit 0" > /tmp/pass
    $ echo "exit 1" > /tmp/fail
    $ avocado run --external-runner=/bin/sh /tmp/pass /tmp/fail
    JOB ID    : <id>
    JOB LOG   : /home/user/avocado/job-results/job-<date>-<shortid>/job.log
    TESTS      : 2
    (1/2) /tmp/pass: PASS (0.01 s)
    (2/2) /tmp/fail: FAIL: Exited with status: '1', stdout: '' stderr: '' (0.02 s)
    RESULTS    : PASS 1 | ERROR 0 | FAIL 1 | SKIP 0 | WARN 0 | INTERRUPT 0 | CANCEL 0
    JOB TIME   : 0.11 s

This example is pretty obvious, and could be achieved by giving
`/tmp/pass` and `/tmp/fail` shell "shebangs" (`#!/bin/sh`), making
them executable (`chmod +x /tmp/pass /tmp/fail)`, and running them as
"SIMPLE" tests.

But now consider the following example::

    $ avocado run --external-runner=/bin/curl http://local-avocado-server:9405/jobs/ \
                                              http://remote-avocado-server:9405/jobs/
    JOB ID    : <id>
    JOB LOG   : /home/user/avocado/job-results/job-<date>-<shortid>/job.log
    TESTS      : 2
    (1/2) http://local-avocado-server:9405/jobs/: PASS (0.02 s)
    (2/2) http://remote-avocado-server:9405/jobs/: FAIL (3.02 s)
    RESULTS    : PASS 1 | ERROR 0 | FAIL 1 | SKIP 0 | WARN 0 | INTERRUPT 0 | CANCEL 0
    JOB TIME   : 3.14 s

This effectively makes `/bin/curl` an "external test runner",
responsible for trying to fetch those URLs, and reporting PASS or FAIL
for each of them.

RECORDING TEST REFERENCE OUTPUT
===============================

As a tester, you may want to check if the output of a given application
matches an expected output. In order to help with this common use case,
we offer the option ``--output-check-record [mode]`` to the test runner.
If this option is used, it will store the stdout or stderr of the
process (or both, if you specified ``all``) being executed to reference
files: ``stdout.expected`` and ``stderr.expected``.

Those files will be recorded in the test data dir. The data dir is in
the same directory as the test source file, named
``[source_file_name.data]``. Let's take as an example the test
``synctest.py``. In a fresh checkout of avocado, you can see::

        examples/tests/synctest.py.data/stderr.expected
        examples/tests/synctest.py.data/stdout.expected

From those 2 files, only stdout.expected is non empty::

    $ cat examples/tests/synctest.py.data/stdout.expected
    PAR : waiting
    PASS : sync interrupted

The output files were originally obtained using the test runner and
passing the option `--output-check-record` all to the test runner::

    $ avocado run --output-check-record all examples/tests/synctest.py
    JOB ID    : <id>
    JOB LOG   : /home/user/avocado/job-results/job-<date>-<shortid>/job.log
     (1/1) examples/tests/synctest.py:SyncTest.test: PASS (4.00 s)
    RESULTS    : PASS 1 | ERROR 0 | FAIL 0 | SKIP 0 | WARN 0 | INTERRUPT 0
    JOB TIME   : 4.10 s

After the reference files are added, the check process is transparent,
in the sense that you do not need to provide special flags to the test
runner. Now, every time the test is executed, after it is done running,
it will check if the outputs are exactly right before considering the
test as PASSed. If you want to override the default behavior and skip
output check entirely, you may provide the flag ``--output-check=off``
to the test runner.

The ``avocado.utils.process`` APIs have a parameter
``allow_output_check`` (defaults to ``all``), so that you can select
which process outputs will go to the reference files, should you chose
to record them. You may choose ``all``, for both stdout and stderr,
``stdout``, for the stdout only, ``stderr``, for only the stderr only,
or ``none``, to allow neither of them to be recorded and checked.

This process works fine also with simple tests, executables that return
0 (PASSed) or != 0 (FAILed). Let's consider our bogus example::

    $ cat output_record.sh
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Hello, world!"

Let's record the output (both stdout and stderr) for this one::

    $ avocado run output_record.sh --output-check-record all
    JOB ID    : <id>
    JOB LOG   : /home/user/avocado/job-results/job-<date>-<shortid>/job.log
     (1/1) output_record.sh: PASS (0.01 s)
    RESULTS    : PASS 1 | ERROR 0 | FAIL 0 | SKIP 0 | WARN 0 | INTERRUPT 0 | CANCEL 0
    JOB HTML   : /home/user/avocado/job-results/job-<date>-<shortid>/results.html
    JOB TIME   : 0.11 s

After this is done, you'll notice that a the test data directory
appeared in the same level of our shell script, containing 2 files::

    $ ls output_record.sh.data/
    stderr.expected  stdout.expected

Let's look what's in each of them::

    $ cat output_record.sh.data/stdout.expected
    Hello, world!
    $ cat output_record.sh.data/stderr.expected
    $

Now, every time this test runs, it'll take into account the expected
files that were recorded, no need to do anything else but run the test.

LINUX DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES
============================

Avocado has some planned features that depend on knowing the Linux
Distribution being used on the system. The most basic command prints the
detected Linux Distribution::

    $ avocado distro
    Detected distribution: fedora (x86_64) version 21 release 0

Other features are available with the same command when command line
options are given, as shown by the `--help` option.

For instance, it possible to create a so-called "Linux Distribution
Definition" file, by inspecting an installation tree. The installation
tree could be the contents of the official installation ISO or a local
network mirror.

These files let Avocado pinpoint if a given installed package is part of
the original Linux Distribution or something else that was installed
from an external repository or even manually. This, in turn, can help
detecting regressions in base system packages that affected a given test
result.

To generate a definition file run::

    $ avocado distro --distro-def-create --distro-def-name avocadix  \
                     --distro-def-version 1 --distro-def-arch x86_64 \
                     --distro-def-type rpm --distro-def-path /mnt/dvd

And the output will be something like::

    Loading distro information from tree... Please wait...
    Distro information saved to "avocadix-1-x86_64.distro"
